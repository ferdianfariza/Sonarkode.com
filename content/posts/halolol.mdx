# A sample post with markdown.

Of course, celebrating and encouraging a growth mindset is all good and well, but how do we put in place structures and processes that actually encourage career growth?

In the Engineering org, we’ve thought deeply about how to foster long-term growth opportunities for people. Like some companies, our progression track for engineers splits in two after senior engineer – either continuing as an IC at staff or principal levels, or taking a turn into people management.

# Engineering career path

For many people, however, making a move into management can feel like meeting a fork in the road – it feels like a choice that cannot easily be revisited. That doesn’t need to be the case, however. Here’s how we think about that career path.

Unlike a lot of companies, Intercom provides tailored training and 1:1 support for engineers who are interested in branching out into management. Unlike almost all companies Intercom facilitates what some call the engineer/manager pendulum – or a switch back to the IC track after some time as a manager.

# This is example of H2


Why? We believe in matching people to roles that play to their strengths and interests. We believe that after, say, two years growing into and working as an engineering manager, our Intercomrades will be good engineering managers and better engineers.

If it turns out after two years the role that now aligns with their strengths and interests is that of an engineer, why wouldn’t we offer a path back? Especially since they’re better engineers than when they left for management.

So why do we think they are better?

Leverage.

# Increasing leverage through people management

If you’re a senior engineer, or indeed an engineer at any level, spend some time in management. Enough time that it gets hard and you get to fail big, feel some pain, recover and learn.

At the very worst you’ll come back to engineering a better engineer with a deep understanding of how to scale yourself through people, how to take on bigger and harder projects, and a newfound ability to gain perspective by going broad and deep across many different disciplines and concerns. At the very best, you’ll develop a love for a different, potentially deeply satisfying way of building new things at a new level of scale.

# The different paths to career growth

Then, when the need arises, you’ll need to be able to go deep. Deep into the details of the feasibility of a technical plan, the rationale of a long-range technical decision, or the motivations of your star performers. To do this effectively, you’ll need to develop not only expertise, but the ability to be an expert in not being an expert. The ability to lean on other disciplines, experts, and perspectives and to synthesize your learnings into understanding and then action. To manage your time effectively you’ll need to figure out how deep is too deep, and what the right zoom level is, and this will take practice.

So while your raw execution skills in the codebase might be rusting as a manager, your general ability to quickly absorb and synthesize new perspectives across different concerns and different domains, at different zoom levels, becomes a key tool to your effectiveness.

What’s important to appreciate is that this is also one of the key tools you need to develop as you grow from senior engineer to staff and principal levels. The skillset you acquire as a manager is not restricted to management, but amplifies your impact should you return to engineering.
